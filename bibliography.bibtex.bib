@article{mecklin2005,
	Abstract = { Many multivariate statistical methods call upon the assumption of multivariate normality (MVN). However, many researchers fail to test this assumption. This omission could be due to either ignorance of the existence of tests of MVN or confusion about which test to use. Although at least 50 tests of MVN exist, relatively little is known about the power of these procedures. The purpose of this study was to examine the power of 13 promising tests of MVN with a Monte Carlo study. Ten thousand data sets were generated from several multivariate distributions. The test statistic for each procedure was calculated and compared with the appropriate critical value. The number of rejections of the null hypothesis of MVN was tabled for each situation. No single test was found to be the most powerful in all situations. The use of the Henze--Zirkler test is recommended as a formal test of MVN. Supplementary procedures such as Mardia's skewness and kurtosis measures and the chi-square plot are also recommended for diagnosing possible deviations from normality.},

For testing the hypothesisHdthat the law ofX1is some nondegenerate normal distribution, there is a whole class of practicable affine invariant and universally consistent tests. These procedures are based on weighted integrals of the squared modulus of the difference between the empirical characteristic function of the scaled residualsYj=S−1/2(Xj−X) and its almost sure pointwise limit exp(−‖t‖2/2) underHd. The test statistics have an alternative interpretation in terms ofL2-distances between a nonparametric kernel density estimator and the parametric density estimator underHd, applied toY1, {\ldots}, Yn. By working in the Fr{\'e}chet space of continuous functions on View the MathML sourced, we obtain a new representation of the limiting null distributions of the test statistics and show that the tests have asymptotic power against sequences of contiguous alternatives converging toHdat the raten−1/2, independent ofd.},

@article{mardia:1974,
	Abstract = {Some measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis have been proposed by Mardia (1970). For further theoretical investigations and applications, alternative forms of these measures are obtained. One of these forms is convenient for computer programming and, incidentally, provides a simpler proof of the invariance property of these measures. For mixtures of multivariate normal distributions, the measures are studied in relation to a measure of non-normality of Day (1969). Our investigation together with those of Hopkins and Clay (1963) indicates that the size of the normal theory tests of covariance matrices is extremely sensitive to kurtosis. A method to derive exact moments of these measures for samples from a multivariate normal population is developed; our approach is somewhat similar to Geary (1933) for the univariate case rather than Fisher (1930) who first solved this problem. Some suitable small sample approximations to the null distributions of the measures are then derived. Monte Carlo studies and these approximations are used to calculate critical values of a test of multivariate normality. A numerical example with small sample size is given.},

The asymptotic distributions of the measures for samples from a multivariate normal population are derived and a test of multivariate normality is proposed. The effect of nonnormality on the size of the one-sample Hotelling's T2 test is studied empirically with the help of these measures, and it is found that Hotelling's T2 test is more sensitive to the measure of skewness than to the measure of kurtosis.},
